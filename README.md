# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Pattern
Building and training a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bike share users on the given day

In this project, i have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset!
By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts pertaining to neural network.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

## Problem to solve
Neural Network for predicting Bike users on the given day : Here NN will predict how many bikes a company needs because if they have too few they are losing money from potential riders and if they have too many they are wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So NN will predict from the hisitorical data the number of bikes needed for a profitable business.
